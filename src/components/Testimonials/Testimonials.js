            Was grateful for the opportunity to work with Abhi. His ability to keep development commitments and constantly drive himself to continuously learn made him a dev that could be relied on to take any stories off our agile boards (front end and back end) and complete. Additionally his constant attention to detail ensured the stories were built to spec and of high quality and appreciated how much he cared about the products and features he supported by engaging in conversations on what dev patterns should be implemented to support the work (both short term and long term).

            Abhinav is a very quicker learner in respect of the technology and tools that we used on the project at CVS Health. He is a good communicator and produced very good written documentation for the development work he did. His contribution to the project was very valued and team player for the project.
