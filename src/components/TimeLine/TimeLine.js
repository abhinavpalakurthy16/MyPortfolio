      <SectionSubText> 
        I hold a Masters Degree in the field of Computer Science from University of the Central Missouri. 
        I'm interested about bringing digital products' technical and visual features to life. 
        User experience, pixels perfection, and developing clean, human-readable code are all important to me.
        Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at many companies, a start-up, and a huge corporations. 
        <br />
        When I'm not pushing pixels or logics, you'll find me cooking, chilling or go out with my friends.
